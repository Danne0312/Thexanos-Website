            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Xanos!

                A 24-year-old from Lithuania. Iâ€™ve been streaming on Twitch for 4 years now and have formed a community of dedicated people who canâ€™t leave â€“ maybe youâ€™re next! ðŸ™‚ I usually focus on a variety of just chatting topics, whether serious or funny. Sometimes, we also play games from which we try to extract engaging content, often integrating my community to share the spotlight.
                
                I began gaming around the ages of 4-5, initially starting with Warcraft 2, Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, and Diablo 2. Influenced by my brother to be tech-savvy, Iâ€™ve always heavily focused on IT throughout my life â€“ gaming, rarely going outside, having a few friends, and building/fixing computers.
                
                Later on, I attended two colleges to study IT but realized that being a programmer or working in IT was not my true calling and I didnâ€™t like my direction in life, so I quit. After that, I started streaming, and here I am today. Over the past 4 years, the stream has helped me discover so much about myself that I never realized, and now Iâ€™m considering attending university for the first time. But weâ€™ll see where that leads me.
                
                Welcome to my stream, I hope you enjoy your stay ðŸ™‚</p>
